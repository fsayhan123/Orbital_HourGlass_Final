# Motivation

Ever done a group project but found it hard to decide on a timeslot? Fret no more! With a feature that allows the event creator to decide on a date once participants respond with their availability, it will be much easier to decide on timings to meet. 

To make things even better, the events created can then be synced with calendars like Google Calendar or Outlook. Participants and users also have the option of creating to-do checklists for each event, so that at a glance, users can see tasks and events.

Included in this software bundle is an expenses tracker. We believe that integrating this nudge in a frequently used application will help users better track their daily expenses.

# Aim 

To integrate aspects of usersâ€™ daily lives all rolled into an application. To serve as a tracker - of to-dos, events and even other miscellaneous things (e.g. expenses), to help you better manage your life.
